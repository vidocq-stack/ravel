## BUG-20260712-01 — hardcoded implementation version constant in the published api artifact

- **Date** : 2026-07-12
- **Statut** : FIXED (branch fix/build-derived-version — ships with the next release)
- **Module touché** : Ravel.IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION (ravel-api/Ravel.java)
- **Symptôme** : the artifact published on Maven Central as 0.2.0 reports a hardcoded
  "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT" implementation version — the constant was maintained by hand and never
  updated by the release train. Same class as vidocq BUG-20260704-01 (CLI banner).
- **Reproduction minimale** : read the constant from the published 0.2.0 jar.
- **Hypothèse de cause** : compile-time constant, no build filtering.
- **Investigations** :
  - 2026-07-12 : found by grepping for stale version strings after the issue #3 follow-up.
    Fixed: version.properties filtered by Maven next to the class, constant loaded at class
    init (same-module JPMS resource, no opens). No longer compile-time-inlineable, which
    also protects future consumers from the javac inlining trap.
